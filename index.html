          Marcus Aurelius (Marcus Aurelius Antoninus; 26 April 121 – 17 March
          180) was a Roman emperor from 161 to 180 and a Stoic philosopher. He
          was the last of the rulers known as the Five Good Emperors (a term
          coined some 13 centuries later by Niccolò Machiavelli), and the last
          emperor of the Pax Romana, an age of relative peace and stability for
          the Roman Empire. He served as Roman consul in 140, 145, and 161.

          Marcus was born during the reign of Hadrian to the emperor's nephew,
          the praetor Marcus Annius Verus and the heiress Domitia Lucilla. His
          father died when he was three, and Marcus was raised by his mother and
          grandfather. After Hadrian's adoptive son, Aelius Caesar, died in 138,
          the emperor adopted Marcus' uncle Antoninus Pius as his new heir. In
          turn, Antoninus adopted Marcus and Lucius, the son of Aelius.
        </p>
        <p>
          Antoninus became emperor. Now heir to the throne, Marcus studied Greek
          and Latin under tutors such as Herodes Atticus and Marcus Cornelius
          Fronto. He kept in close correspondence with Fronto for many years
          afterwards. Marcus married Antoninus' daughter Faustina in 145. After
          Antoninus died in 161, Marcus acceded to the throne alongside his
          adoptive brother Lucius, who took the name Lucius Verus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reign of Marcus Aurelius was marked by military conflict. In the
          East, the Roman Empire fought successfully with a revitalized Parthian
          Empire and the rebel Kingdom of Armenia. Marcus defeated the
          Marcomanni, Quadi, and Sarmatian Iazyges in the Marcomannic Wars;
          however, these and other Germanic peoples began to represent a
          troubling reality for the Empire. He modified the silver purity of the
          Roman currency, the denarius. The persecution of Christians in the
          Roman Empire appears to have increased during his reign, but it is
          unknown how involved Marcus was in the persecution. The Antonine
          Plague broke out in 165 or 166 and devastated the population of the
          Roman Empire, causing the deaths of five million people. Lucius Verus
          may have died from the plague in 169.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike some of his predecessors, Marcus chose not to adopt an heir.
          His children included Lucilla, who married Lucius, and Commodus, whose
          succession after Marcus has become a subject of debate among both
          contemporary and modern historians. The Column and Equestrian Statue
          of Marcus Aurelius still stand in Rome, where they were erected in
          celebration of his military victories. Meditations, the writings of
          "the philosopher" – as contemporary biographers called Marcus, are a
          significant source of the modern understanding of ancient Stoic
          philosophy. They have been praised by fellow writers, philosophers,
          monarchs, and politicians centuries after his death.
